**Description:** In this lecture, Prof. Liu first discusses the causal structure of black hole geometry, and that of a closely related spacetime called Rindler spacetime. He shows that a black hole has a nonzero temperature to an observer at infinity. He also derives a closely related phenomenon: In Minkowski spacetime, an accelerated observer feels a temperature proportional to her acceleration.

**Instructor:** Hong Liu
